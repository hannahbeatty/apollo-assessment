PLANNING DOC
genflow = client (use postman for now)
    -> api layer (flask) 
    -> validation 
    -> data access (ORM/SQL) (made from data_model)
    -> database 

timeline

Phase 1 - implement database
    # make datamodel in python

    data access
        # orm implementation? like how i did for smart home networking?
        ^ then if I have time optimize the sql calls??
        # would making a local cache make sense here

    database
        sqlite or postgres/mysql (simple enough for litw?)

ORRRR raw sql approach


Phase 2 - implement CRUD APIs

FLASK!
    from pdf
    GET /vehicle
    POST /vehicle
    GET /vehicle/<vin>
    PUT /vehicle/<vin>
    DELETE /vehicle/<vin>

    receive requests
    Parse JSON
    Pass validated data to the service/database layer
    Return JSON responses with correct HTTP status codes

Phase 3 - Implement Testing (throughout)
    unit test throughout via POSTMAN
    use pytest, add testing config, check unix stuff

Phase 4 - Cleanup + documentation
    do this later lol



things to add:
- doc strings to all funcs
- standard testing, not just postman
    ^ need test config
- documentation (research this?)
